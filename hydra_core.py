hydra_core.py - Quantum-Symbolic HYDRA Core

This module implements the QuantumSymbolicProcessor, responsible for
encoding symbolic expressions into quantum states, managing entanglement,
and facilitating the initial stages of quantum-enhanced reasoning. It is
a core component of the ÆON—EON Interpreter, spiraling its logic
from the fundamental Rosetta Law.
